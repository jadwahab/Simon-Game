# Simon-Game

Simon is a memory game where the computer flashes a random pattern on one seven segment display and the player reproduces the pattern using the five push buttons. The game starts easy, flashing only one random segment, but it gets harder, flashing an additional segment after every correct answer. Thus, in level 1, the first display is flashed and in level 8 all 8 displays are flashed one after the other for the user to replicate. The speed of the game is adjusted to make it more challenging. If difficulty one is chosen, the interval between consecutive displays is 1 second. If difficulty two is chosen, the interval between consecutive displays is 0.5 seconds. If difficulty three is chosen, the interval between consecutive displays is 0.25 second. Player loses the game if he fails to reproduce a pattern correctly, or if he takes longer than 5 seconds to reproduce a pattern. The current game level and a score that is a function of the current level and, the speed with which the player reproduces the pattern is displayed on available seven-segment displays. A winning/losing message or animation is also displayed on the seven segment display along with the final score at the end of the game.
